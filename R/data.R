#' Sacurine data from ropls
#'
#' Urine samples from 183 human adults were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution
#' mass spectrometry (LTQ Orbitrap) in the negative ionization mode. A total of 109 metabolites were
#' identified or annotated at the MSI level 1 or 2. After retention time alignment with XCMS, peaks were
#' integrated with Quan Browser. After signal drift and batch effect correction of intensities, each urine
#' profile was normalized to the osmolality of the sample. Finally, the data were log10 transformed.
